Special Note

1: 
This project is divided into two parts, the first part is the license plate image positioning and segmentation, and the second part is the use of Google's pytesseract to perform text recognition on the license plate image.
Please note that your computer may need to be configured with pytesseract to run ORC. py

2:
You must first run NSCarPlateLocator. py to get the output image, and then allow ORC. py to get text information

3:
Because the current knowledge of machine learning is lacking, Google's ORC library can only be used for identification. Therefore, the quality of recognition is relatively low, but if the image is recognized by machine learning, it will be greatly improved.

Special Thanks:
